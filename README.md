# Installation

Credit to [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) for making it really easy to manage all of the config files and symlinks.

All it takes is one command
```
git clone https://github.com/T-Braico/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install
```
and one more to install Packer for Neovim
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomas/packer.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
