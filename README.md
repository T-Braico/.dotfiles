# Installation

Credit to [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) for making it really easy to manage all of the config files and symlinks.

```
# Install Packer for nvim
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim "$HOME/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim"

# clone and install config
git clone https://github.com/T-Braico/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```
